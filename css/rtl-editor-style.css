All your awesome rtl Editor Styles go here, we like WYSIWYG

http://codex.wordpress.org/Right_to_Left_Language_Support

Adding support for language written in a Right To Left (RTL) direction is easy -
it's just a matter of overwriting all the horizontal positioning attributes
of your CSS stylesheet in a separate stylesheet file named rtl.css.
